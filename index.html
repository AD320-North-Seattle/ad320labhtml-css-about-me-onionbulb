            <p class="text">I was born in Washington and have been here ever since.
                My interest in programming comes from programming itself being a creative outlet,
                since I've always felt like I couldn't express myself properly through writing or art.
                Some of my recent experiences with web development is a Wordle clone using characters from
                a game my friends and I play, and working on an open-source code autograder to add new features and
                streamline the client-server interactions.
